#NOTE: keep this in mind:
Systemd: If the device is mounted by systemd, you can use systemd's capabilities to access the mount point.

1âœ…) Using the DEVICE_PATH will give me the block device
example: /dev/sda1 (or whatever)

I need to append that to the end of this command:

udisksctl mount -b DEVICE_PATH

2) Outstanding, i have the device mounted by now!

Next I need get to this path found at:

/run/media/$USER/$LABEL and create an ENV var for it

3) Once i have access to that path, i can back things up here.
Before i do that, make sure i can reach that path in step 2

Basically i want to use this command when copying:

#NOTE: This works for the current directory only
cp -r * PATH_TO_FLASHDRIVE
